# CTEC 126 - Zhong's Final Project Specification

## Project Summary

- The project will be a quiz module that presents the user with questions from the game show _Jeopardy!_
- The [jService API](http://jservice.io/), which is a database of _Jeopardy!_ questions, will be used.

## Quiz Features

- Before the quiz starts, the user can select how many questions they'd like to answer (between 3 and 20).
- On the quiz screen, the user is presented with the category, the question, and a timer that counts the number of seconds elapsed.
- Statistics displayed will include the total number of questions, the current question number, and the user's total score.
- Buttons will include the next button, end quiz button, and show answer button.
- The user can input an answer string, and can submit their answer to be checked.
- After each question, information about the question number, whether or not the user got the question correct, the question difficulty, and the time elapsed will be stored into an array to be displayed later in the results screen.

## Content

The pages for the project will be divided into: 
1. The main quiz module feature
2. The results screen
3. The credits page

## Milestone Goals

- **Milestone 2:** Make sure the API is set up correctly and working. Set up basic HTML structure for each of the three pages and decide on a CSS style/framework to use.
- **Milestone 3:** Ensure that basic Javascript functionality for the quiz is working correctly. Bugs are still expected at this stage. 
- **Milestone 4:** Completed and refined project.
